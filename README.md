🌼 Pixel-Peace
A Retro 90s Anxiety-Relief Game Website

Pixel-peace is a web-based, 90s-inspired pixel-art game designed to help users reduce anxiety through soothing interactions, grounding techniques, and nostalgic aesthetics.
It blends the charm of retro gaming with modern psychological calming practices to create a simple, cozy, anxiety-friendly digital space.

🎮 About the Project

Pixel-Peace aims to give users a gentle moment of peace. Instead of overwhelming interfaces, timers, or high-stimulus visuals, the app recreates the simplicity of old-school games—low pressure, comforting, and slow-paced.

The user explores a tiny pixel world, interacts with calming objects, practices breathing exercises, and completes grounding quests. Every mechanic is intentionally soft, encouraging relaxation through play.
